# FormattedField

## Overview
`FormattedField` is a lightweight, read‑only React component that prints the value of a single entity field, automatically applying the default formatting rules of the underlying Contember project (numbers, dates, enums, booleans, etc.).  
Use it whenever you need to show a single piece of data—such as a title, price, or published‑at date—inside lists, detail pages, or custom dashboards without writing your own formatting logic.

---

## Core Concepts
• Entity Context – The component must live somewhere inside an `Entity` (or any component that provides an entity context). It uses that context to resolve the field value.  
• Sugared Field Path – The required `field` prop accepts the “sugared” relative field path (e.g. `title`, `category.name`, `priceWithVat`).  
• Automatic Formatting – The component inspects the field’s Contember schema type and prints it in a user‑friendly form (e.g. dates as `YYYY‑MM‑DD`, booleans as `✓/✕`, enums as their label).  
• Pure Display – `FormattedField` never mutates data; it only renders. Use `TextField`, `NumberField`, etc. for editable inputs.

---

## Quick Start
```tsx
import { Entity, FormattedField } from '@contember/admin';

const BookListItem = () => (
	<Entity>
		<strong>
			<FormattedField field="title" />
		</strong>
		<div>
			Published:&nbsp;
			<FormattedField field="publishedAt" />
		</div>
	</Entity>
);
```

## Props Reference
| Name  | Type                                            | Default | Description                                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| field | SugaredRelativeSingleField['field'] (string)    | –       | Relative path of the field to display (e.g. `"title"`). Must reference a *scalar* column, not a relation. |

---

## Requirements
• Must be rendered **inside** a component that provides an entity context (`<Entity>` or `<SubTree>`).  
• The referenced field has to be a scalar (string, number, bool, enum, date, etc.). Relations are **not** supported.

---

## Features
• Zero‑configuration formatting based on field type.  
• Supports nested field paths (`author.email`).  
• Works in table rows, cards, detail views, and anywhere a React node is accepted.  
• Lightweight – renders a single `<span>` or the content directly (no extra DOM noise).

## Usage Examples

### Basic usage inside a list
```tsx
<ListRenderer entities="Book">
	{book => (
		<li key={book.id}>
			<FormattedField field="title" /> — <FormattedField field="price" />
		</li>
	)}
</ListRenderer>
```
Renders a bullet‑list with each book’s title and price formatted according to the project locale.

### Nested (relative) field path
```tsx
// Assuming the Book entity has a relation `category` with scalar `name`
<FormattedField field="category.name" />
```
Prints the category name of the current book.

### Combining with custom markup
```tsx
<p>
	Last update:&nbsp;
	<time>
		<FormattedField field="updatedAt" />
	</time>
</p>
```
`FormattedField` returns plain text, so you can wrap it in semantic HTML elements such as `<time>`.

## When to Use
• You need to display a single scalar value quickly without writing formatting/parsing logic.  
• You are building read‑only pages (dashboards, print views, exports) where consistency matters.  
• Listing data in tables or lists inside an admin panel.

## When Not to Use
• You need to **edit** or validate the field – use input components (`TextField`, `NumberField`, …) instead.  
• You require custom formatting (e.g. currency symbols, date locales) – fetch the raw value via `FieldView` or React hooks and format manually.  
• The target is a relation (e.g. array of tags) – use `HasMany` loops or custom renderers.

---

## Best Practices & Gotchas
• Keep the `field` prop short and relative; avoid starting with the root entity name.  
• For performance, avoid nesting it deeply inside loops when you can lift common markup up.  
• Remember that enums are printed as their **label**, not the raw enum value.

## Further Reading
• `Entity` – Provides the data context required by `FormattedField`.  
• `FieldView` – Low‑level component for full control over data formatting.  
• Input Components (`TextField`, `DateField`, …) – Use when you need editability.
