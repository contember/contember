When you're ready to launch your application, you have two choices with Contember: using our managed hosting service, Contember Cloud, or self-hosting.

## Contember Cloud

For beginners, Contember Cloud is a great choice. It simplifies deployment by handling complex tasks, like scaling and security. You also get professional support from us, so you won't be left in the dark if problems arise. It's an easy and cost-effective solution that lets you focus on building your application.

## Self-hosting

If you want more control, you can self-host. Contember is open-source, so you can manage your own deployment. But remember, with more control comes more responsibility. You'll have to handle server maintenance and security. This choice is best for advanced users or teams with IT support.
