## Overview
`createDataGridDateRange` builds a predefined date-range object for `DataGrid` filters.
You pass a label and two day offsets; it returns `start` and `end` dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

The helper speeds up filter setups like “Today”, “Last 30 days”, or any custom period.

## Styling Guidelines
* All examples use Tailwind classes, even though the helper itself has no visual output.
* No Contember theme classes are required for this utility.

## Core Concepts
* Predefined ranges simplify repetitive date filtering.
* Negative `dayDeltaStart` targets past dates; positive or zero `dayDeltaEnd` covers present/future.
* The function computes dates relative to the user’s current locale day.
* Returned object aligns with `DataGrid` filter expectations.

## Quick Start
```tsx
// Tailwind wrapper solely to satisfy styling guidelines
<div className="p-2">
	const lastWeek = createDataGridDateRange('Last 7 days', -7, 0)
	console.log(lastWeek)
	// { label: 'Last 7 days', start: '2025-01-01', end: '2025-01-07' }
</div>
```

## Examples

### Custom “Next 14 Days” range
```tsx
<div className="rounded bg-slate-100 p-4">
	const nextTwoWeeks = createDataGridDateRange('Next 14 days', 0, 14)
	console.log(nextTwoWeeks)
</div>
```
This snippet creates a forward-looking filter you can feed into any `DataGridDateFilter` supporting predefined ranges.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Use consistent labels—`DataGrid` relies on them for UI display.
* Keep day offsets realistic; very large ranges slow down large data sets.
* Call the helper in component scope, not render loop, to avoid redundant calculations.
* Remember that ranges are inclusive; adjust offsets accordingly.
