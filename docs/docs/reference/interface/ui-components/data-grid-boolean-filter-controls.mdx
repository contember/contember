## Overview
`DataGridBooleanFilterControls` renders a UI control that filters `DataGrid` rows by a boolean column value.
The component is marked `@internal`, so its API can change without notice.

## Styling Guidelines
* All example blocks in this documentation use Tailwind CSS utility classes.
* The component itself does not require any Contember–specific theme classes.

## Core Concepts
* Boolean filtering in a `DataGrid`.
* Rendering controls that map to `true`, `false`, and “all” states.
* Composability with other `DataGrid` filter components.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Prefer higher-level public components when possible; this component’s API can change.
* Wrap the control in your own component to maintain stability across Contember upgrades.

## Further Reading
* `DataGrid`
* `DataGridFilterState`
* Contember filtering utilities
