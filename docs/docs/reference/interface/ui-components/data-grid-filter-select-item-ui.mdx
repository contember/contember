# DataGridFilterSelectItemUI

## Overview
DataGridFilterSelectItemUI renders one selectable item within a DataGrid filter dropdown.
You can mark the item as included or excluded and react to user clicks with callbacks.

## Styling Guidelines
All examples use Tailwind CSS.
No additional Contember theme classes are required.

## Core Concepts
* Each item represents one entity record inside a filter.
* You can include or exclude the entity independently.
* Callbacks update the surrounding filter state.
* The component is visually independent; styling happens via Tailwind.

## Quick Start
```tsx
import { DataGridFilterSelectItemUI } from '@app/lib/datagrid/ui'

const UserFilterItem = ({ id, name, includedIds, excludedIds, toggleInclude, toggleExclude }) => (
	<DataGridFilterSelectItemUI
		className="flex items-center gap-2 px-3 py-1 hover:bg-gray-100"
		onInclude={() => toggleInclude(id)}
		onExclude={() => toggleExclude(id)}
		isIncluded={includedIds.includes(id)}
		isExcluded={excludedIds.includes(id)}
	>
		<span>{name}</span>
	</DataGridFilterSelectItemUI>
)
```

## Props Reference
| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| children | ReactNode | Yes | – | Content shown inside the item. |
| onInclude | () => void | No | – | Called when the user marks the item as included. |
| onExclude | () => void | No | – | Called when the user marks the item as excluded. |
| isIncluded | boolean | No | `false` | Visual state: item is currently included. |
| isExcluded | boolean | No | `false` | Visual state: item is currently excluded. |
| *Inherited props* | – | – | – | All standard props accepted by the underlying HTML element. |

## Sub-Components / Building Blocks
### DataGridFilterSelectTriggerUI
Works with DataGridFilterSelectItemUI to open and close the dropdown.
You usually pair TriggerUI and ItemUI inside DataGridSingleFilterUI.

## Examples

### Include / Exclude toggling inside a list
```tsx
const EntityItem = ({ entity, toggleInclude, toggleExclude, included, excluded }) => (
	<DataGridFilterSelectItemUI
		className="flex items-center justify-between w-full px-4 py-2 hover:bg-slate-50"
		onInclude={() => toggleInclude(entity.id)}
		onExclude={() => toggleExclude(entity.id)}
		isIncluded={included.includes(entity.id.toString())}
		isExcluded={excluded.includes(entity.id.toString())}
	>
		<span className="truncate">{entity.label}</span>
	</DataGridFilterSelectItemUI>
)
```
The component receives callbacks and state arrays from a parent.
It updates the filter state without internal storage.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Keep callbacks stable with `useCallback` to avoid re-renders.
* Only one of `isIncluded` or `isExcluded` should be true at the same time.
* Pass explicit `className` values; the component does not provide spacing.
