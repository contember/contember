# DataGridLayoutSwitcher

## Overview
`DataGridLayoutSwitcher` lets users toggle between predefined data-grid layouts.
It renders a row of buttons and applies the selected layout instantly.

## Styling Guidelines
* All examples use Tailwind CSS classes.
* The component does not require any special Contember theme classes out of the box.

## Core Concepts
* Switching between multiple grid layouts at runtime.
* Providing visual affordance through a button group.
* Persisting the chosen layout in a parent context or state (handled outside this component).

## Quick Start
```tsx
import { DataGridLayoutSwitcher } from "@contember/react-datagrid";

export const Demo = () => (
	<div className="p-4">
		<DataGridLayoutSwitcher />
	</div>
);
```

## Examples

### Toolbar integration
Place the switcher next to other grid controls.

```tsx
export const ToolbarWithLayout = () => (
	<div className="flex items-center gap-3 border-b p-2">
		<DataGridLayoutSwitcher />
		<button className="btn btn-primary">Add Row</button>
	</div>
);
```
The switcher stays visually aligned with custom buttons thanks to `flex` utilities.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Keep the number of layouts low to avoid decision fatigue.
* Group the switcher with other grid actions for better discoverability.
* Manage the selected layout in a higher component if you need persistence across pages.
