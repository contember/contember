# ErrorBoundary

## Overview
ErrorBoundary traps runtime errors inside its React subtree.
When a child throws, the component swaps in a fallback UI and prevents the whole app from crashing.

## Styling Guidelines
* All snippets use Tailwind classes.
* ErrorBoundary itself renders no DOM. No Contember theme classes are required.

## Core Concepts
* React error boundaries catch render-time exceptions.
* You supply a `fallback` node shown when an error occurs.
* Children continue rendering as usual when no error is thrown.
* State resets once the component unmounts or you re-mount children.

## Quick Start
```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@contember/react-components'

export const Page = () => (
	<ErrorBoundary fallback={<p className="text-red-600">Something went wrong.</p>}>
		<MyRiskyWidget className="border p-4" />
	</ErrorBoundary>
)
```

## Props Reference
| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| fallback | React.ReactNode | No | `null` | UI rendered when a child throws. |
| children | React.ReactNode | Yes | — | Components protected by the boundary. |

## Examples

### Wrap a data-heavy panel
```tsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<Alert className="alert-error">Failed to load panel.</Alert>}>
	<ProjectDashboard className="grid gap-4" />
</ErrorBoundary>
```
Use this pattern when loading complex dashboards that may fail due to network issues.

### Protect an async form
```tsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<p className="text-red-500">Form crashed. Please refresh.</p>}>
	<UserSettingsForm className="space-y-6" />
</ErrorBoundary>
```
Isolate forms so validation bugs do not break surrounding pages.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Keep fallback UI lightweight; complex fallbacks may throw again.
* Place boundaries high enough to cover related widgets, but low enough to keep the rest of the page live.
* Reset state by unmounting the boundary—for example, using a key prop.
