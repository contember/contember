# MemberDeleteDialog

## Styling Guidelines
All examples use Tailwind CSS utility classes. MemberDeleteDialog does not require any specific Contember theme classes.

## Core Concepts
- Confirmation dialogs help you guard against accidental data loss.
- You should mount the dialog in a predictable place in the React tree.
- Pair the dialog with delete triggers so users can reverse their decision before final deletion.

## Quick Start
```tsx
import { MemberDeleteDialog } from '@contember/react-components'

export const Page = () => (
  <div className="p-6">
    <MemberDeleteDialog />
  </div>
)
```

## Best Practices & Gotchas
- Mount the dialog close to the application root to avoid stacking-context issues.
- Keep deletion wording clear and concise to prevent user confusion.
- Use i18n utilities to localize dialog text when your project targets multiple languages.
