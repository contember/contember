# MembershipsControl

## Overview
MembershipsControl renders a controlled input that lets you view and update a list of tenant memberships.
You pass the current `memberships` array and a `setMemberships` callback; the component notifies you whenever the list changes.

## Styling Guidelines
* All examples use Tailwind CSS utility classes.
* No Contember-specific theme classes are required out of the box.

## Core Concepts
* Controlled component – you own the state and update it through `setMemberships`.
* MembershipInput array – represents one or more memberships.
* Optional role configuration – `roles` fine-tunes how roles appear.

## Quick Start
```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { MembershipsControl } from "@contember/react-ui"

export default function MembershipEditor() {
  const [memberships, setMemberships] = useState([])

  return (
    <div className="p-4 space-y-4">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Edit memberships</h2>
      <MembershipsControl
        memberships={memberships}
        setMemberships={setMemberships}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Props Reference
| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| memberships | readonly MembershipInput[] | Yes | — | Current list of memberships. |
| setMemberships | (memberships: MembershipInput[]) => void | Yes | — | Callback invoked with the updated memberships array. |
| roles | RolesConfig | No | — | Optional role configuration. |


## Examples

### Editing memberships inside a settings page
```tsx
function SettingsPage() {
  const [memberships, setMemberships] = useState(sampleMemberships)

  return (
    <section className="max-w-lg mx-auto">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">User settings</h1>
      <MembershipsControl
        memberships={memberships}
        setMemberships={setMemberships}
      />
    </section>
  )
}
```
The component shows the existing memberships and lets you add, remove, or edit them.
When the user modifies the list, `setMemberships` updates the parent state.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Keep the `memberships` array stable; recreate it only when items actually change.
* Memorize heavy callbacks with `useCallback` if you pass additional logic to `setMemberships`.
* Validate the final memberships before sending them to the server.
