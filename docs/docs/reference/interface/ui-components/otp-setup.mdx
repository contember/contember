# `OtpSetup`

## Overview
`OtpSetup` renders a complete user interface for enabling one-time password (OTP) two-factor authentication.
It encapsulates the entire flow, so you only need to drop the component into your page.

## Styling Guidelines
* All examples below use Tailwind CSS.
* The component follows Contember’s default theme; no additional theme classes are required.

## Core Concepts
* Two-factor authentication (2FA) improves account security.
* OTP (usually TOTP) codes change every 30 seconds and are generated by authenticator apps.
* `OtpSetup` handles QR code display, secret generation, and verification in one place.

## Quick Start
```tsx
import { OtpSetup } from '~/lib/tenant'

export default function SecurityPage() {
	return (
		<div className="flex justify-center p-8">
			<OtpSetup />
		</div>
	)
}
```

## Examples

### Inside a settings card
```tsx
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from '@contember/ui'
import { OtpSetup } from '~/lib/tenant'

export default function SettingsSecurity() {
	return (
		<Card className="w-[40rem] max-w-full">
			<CardHeader>
				<CardTitle className="text-2xl">Two-factor setup</CardTitle>
			</CardHeader>
			<CardContent>
				<OtpSetup />
			</CardContent>
		</Card>
	)
}
```
The card wrapper provides a consistent layout, while `OtpSetup` supplies the 2FA workflow.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Place the component on a protected route; only authenticated users should reach it.
* Keep the surrounding layout simple—`OtpSetup` already includes all required UI elements.
* Provide clear navigation back to account settings after successful activation.
* Do not wrap the component in an extra `<form>`; it manages its own internal form state.
