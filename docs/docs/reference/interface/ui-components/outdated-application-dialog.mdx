# OutdatedApplicationDialog

## Styling Guidelines
* All snippets use TailwindCSS utility classes.
* No Contember-specific theme classes are required.

## Core Concepts
* Place the dialog inside the `ApplicationEntrypoint` tree so it can subscribe to application lifecycle events.
* The component renders nothing until the application becomes outdated, then displays a modal asking users to refresh.
* Mount exactly one instance per page to avoid multiple dialogs.

## Quick Start
```tsx
import { OutdatedApplicationDialog } from '~/lib/outdated-application-dialog'

export const App = () => (
	<>
		{/* …other providers & layout components… */}
		<OutdatedApplicationDialog />
	</>
)
```

## Examples

### Global placement in a typical Contember admin
```tsx
() => (
	<ApplicationEntrypoint {...getConfig()}>
		<>
			{/* Other global UI like <Toaster /> */}
			<OutdatedApplicationDialog />
		</>
	</ApplicationEntrypoint>
)
```
The dialog lives alongside other global UI elements (`Toaster`, `DevBar`) so users always see the update prompt, regardless of active page.

### Production-only usage
```tsx
() => (
	<>
		{/* Render only outside development to avoid noise during hot reloads */}
		{!import.meta.env.DEV && <OutdatedApplicationDialog />}
	</>
)
```
Conditionally mounting prevents the dialog from interrupting local development while still safeguarding production users.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Mount the component once, preferably close to the root.
* Wrap it with the same providers that wrap your pages to avoid context mismatches.
* Do not hide the dialog—users need to reload to get the latest code.
* Test in production-like builds; dev servers often auto-refresh and bypass the dialog.

## Further Reading
* `ApplicationEntrypoint` – bootstraps Contember admin apps.
* `Toaster` – displays global notifications that pair well with update dialogs.
