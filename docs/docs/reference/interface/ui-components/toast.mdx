# Toast

## Overview  
_None_

## Styling Guidelines  
All usage examples assume Tailwind CSS is available. The Toast component does not require any Contember-specific theme classes; default Tailwind utilities are sufficient.

## Core Concepts  
- Toasts surface short-lived feedback to the user without disrupting flow.  
- You should display one toast per distinct action to avoid overload.  
- Automatic dismissal keeps the UI uncluttered; manual dismissal is optional.

## Best Practices & Gotchas  
- Queue toasts to avoid overlap when many fire in quick succession.  
- Keep messages concise; aim for fewer than 50 characters.  
- Provide visually distinct success, error, and info variants for clarity.  
- Avoid placing actionable controls inside toasts unless absolutely necessary.  
- Test accessibilityâ€”screen readers should announce toast content.
