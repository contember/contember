title: UploadedAudioView
---

## Overview
UploadedAudioView renders a single audio file stored in Contember.  
You can preview the track, read metadata, and plug in custom edit or destroy actions.

## Core Concepts
* Map Contember entity fields to component props (e.g. `urlField="url"`).
* The component shows an HTML `<audio>` element with built-in controls.
* Optional fields enrich the UI with file name, size, and duration.
* `actions`, `edit`, and `DestroyAction` let you extend or replace parts of the UI.
* Set `noDestroy` to hide the default destroy button.

## Installation
```bash
npm i @contember/react-components
```

```tsx
import { UploadedAudioView } from '@contember/react-components'
```

## Quick Start
```tsx
export const SongPreview = () => (
  <div className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">
    <UploadedAudioView urlField="url" />
  </div>
)
```

## Detailed Guide
1. Provide the public URL field.  
   ```tsx
   <UploadedAudioView urlField="url" />
   ```
2. Add extra metadata fields if you store them.  
   ```tsx
   <UploadedAudioView
     urlField="url"
     fileNameField="fileName"
     durationField="duration"
   />
   ```
3. Inject custom actions.  
   ```tsx
   <UploadedAudioView
     urlField="url"
     actions={<DownloadButton />}
   />
   ```
4. Hide or replace the destroy action.  
   ```tsx
   <UploadedAudioView urlField="url" noDestroy />
   ```

## Component API Reference

#### Props
<!-- props -->

## Examples

### Custom Download Action
```tsx
const DownloadButton = ({ url }: { url: string }) => (
  <a href={url} download className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
    Download
  </a>
)

<UploadedAudioView
  urlField="url"
  actions={<DownloadButton />}
  fileNameField="fileName"
/>
```

### Styled Destroy Action
```tsx
const DangerWrapper = ({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactElement
}) => <span className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-800">{children}</span>

<UploadedAudioView
  urlField="url"
  DestroyAction={DangerWrapper}
/>
```

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Always pass `urlField`; the component throws otherwise.
* Use `noDestroy` when users lack delete permission.
* Keep custom actions compact; they share horizontal space.
* Wrap the player in a fixed-width container to prevent stretching.
