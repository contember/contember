title: UploaderDropzone
---

## Overview
`UploaderDropzone` renders a drag-and-drop area for uploading files.  
Use it inside an uploader context so it can react to active uploads.

The component can show custom placeholder content and automatically disable itself while files upload.

## Core Concepts
* Renders nothing when its uploader context reports active uploads and `inactiveOnUpload` is `true`.
* Accepts any JSX as `dropzonePlaceholder`.
* Requires a surrounding uploader provider that handles file state.

## Installation
```tsx
// Contember project import
import { UploaderDropzone } from '~/lib/upload'
```

## Quick Start
```tsx
export const AvatarUploader = () => (
	<div className="max-w-sm border border-dashed border-gray-300 p-4">
		<UploaderDropzone
			inactiveOnUpload
			dropzonePlaceholder={<div>Drop files here or click to upload</div>}
		/>
	</div>
)
```

## Detailed Guide
1. Wrap the dropzone with a component that creates an uploader context (e.g. `MultiUploader`).  
2. Pass `inactiveOnUpload` to hide the zone while a file is uploading.  
3. Provide `dropzonePlaceholder` to match your design.

```tsx
<MultiUploader baseField="avatar">
	{/* Hidden while a file uploads */}
	<UploaderDropzone
		inactiveOnUpload
		dropzonePlaceholder={
			<button className="w-full py-2 text-center text-sm text-gray-600">
				Select or drop an image
			</button>
		}
	/>
	<UploaderProgress />
</MultiUploader>
```

## Component API Reference

### UploaderDropzone
Renders the interactive file drop area.

#### Props
<!-- props -->

## Examples

### Example 1 – Basic usage
```tsx
<UploaderDropzone
	inactiveOnUpload
	dropzonePlaceholder={<div>Drop files here or click to upload</div>}
/>
```

### Example 2 – Conditional rendering inside an entity form
```tsx
entity => {
	if (entity.getField('file.url').value === null) {
		return (
			<UploaderDropzone
				inactiveOnUpload
				dropzonePlaceholder={
					<Button variant="secondary" size="sm" className="w-full min-h-10">
						{dict.uploader.dropFiles}
					</Button>
				}
			/>
		)
	}
	return <div className="w-full">{/* alternative UI */}</div>
}
```

### Example 3 – Dropzone in a complex form
```tsx
<FormFieldStateProvider>
	<FormContainer label="Gallery">
		<Repeater initialEntityCount={0}>
			<MultiUploader baseField="images">
				<UploaderDropzone dropzonePlaceholder="Drop images here" />
				<UploaderProgress />
			</MultiUploader>
		</Repeater>
	</FormContainer>
</FormFieldStateProvider>
```

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Always place the dropzone inside the uploader context so it can receive upload state.
* Size the parent container; the dropzone fills 100 % width and height.
* Disable the zone with `inactiveOnUpload` to prevent duplicate uploads.
* Replace the placeholder with visuals or buttons that match your brand.

## Further Reading
* MultiUploader – Provides an uploader context and state.
* UploaderProgress – Shows current upload progress.
* UploaderHasFile – Conditionally renders content based on file presence.
