# UploaderProgress

## Styling Guidelines
* All code samples use Tailwind CSS utility classes.
* UploaderProgress relies on Contember UI theme classes injected by surrounding uploader components.

## Core Concepts
* UploaderProgress renders **only** when a file is present (`<UploaderHasFile>`).
* The component subscribes to the uploader context to display real-time progress.
* It has **no props** â€“ styling and behaviour come entirely from context providers.

## Quick Start
```tsx
import {
  Uploader,
  UploaderBase,
  UploaderHasFile,
  UploaderProgress,
  UploaderDropzone,
} from '@contember/admin'

export const ImageUploadField = () => (
  <div className="flex gap-4">
    <Uploader baseField="image">
      <UploaderBase baseField="image">
        <UploaderHasFile>
          <UploaderProgress />
        </UploaderHasFile>
      </UploaderBase>

      <UploaderDropzone dropzonePlaceholder="Drag & drop image here" />
    </Uploader>
  </div>
)
```

## Detailed Guide

### Conditional Rendering
UploaderProgress appears only when a file is queued or uploading. Wrap it with `<UploaderHasFile>` to avoid empty UI:
```tsx
<UploaderHasFile>
  <UploaderProgress />
</UploaderHasFile>
```

### Combining With Repeater
Use UploaderProgress inside repeaters to handle multiple file uploads:
```tsx
<Repeater initialEntityCount={0}>
  <MultiUploader baseField="files">
    <UploaderHasFile>
      <UploaderProgress />
    </UploaderHasFile>
    <UploaderDropzone dropzonePlaceholder="Upload more files" />
  </MultiUploader>
</Repeater>
```

## Examples

### Minimal Progress Indicator
```tsx
<UploaderHasFile>
  <UploaderProgress />
</UploaderHasFile>
```
This snippet shows the smallest possible integration. The progress bar appears whenever a file exists in the current uploader context.

### Single File Upload With Preview
```tsx
<Uploader baseField="avatar">
  <UploaderBase baseField="avatar">
    <UploaderHasFile>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <UploaderProgress />
        <img
          src={entity.getField('url').value}
          className="h-10 w-10 rounded-full object-cover"
        />
      </div>
    </UploaderHasFile>
  </UploaderBase>

  <UploaderDropzone dropzonePlaceholder="Select avatar" />
</Uploader>
```
The progress bar appears while the avatar uploads, then the preview replaces it.

### Multi-File Reordering With Drag & Drop
```tsx
<Repeater initialEntityCount={0}>
  <MultiUploader baseField="gallery">
    <UploaderHasFile>
      <UploaderProgress />
    </UploaderHasFile>
    <UploaderDropzone dropzonePlaceholder="Add images" />
  </MultiUploader>

  <RepeaterSortable>
    <RepeaterSortableEachItem>
      <div className="flex">
        <RepeaterSortableItemActivator>
          <UploaderRepeaterHandleUI />
        </RepeaterSortableItemActivator>
        {children /* your image thumb */}
      </div>
    </RepeaterSortableEachItem>
  </RepeaterSortable>
</Repeater>
```
Each image shows its own progress bar. You can reorder images even while uploads are in progress.

## Best Practices & Gotchas
* Wrap UploaderProgress in `<UploaderHasFile>` to avoid rendering when no file is selected.
* Place it **inside** the uploader that owns the file to ensure correct context.
* Do not give it additional props; it ignores unknown props.
* Use Tailwind spacing utilities (`gap-*`, `mb-*`) for layout instead of custom CSS.
